API Description:
This branch focuses on developing the API for managing the dynamic balancing of airspace capacity based on operational intents. It interfaces with the Resource Status Information Service (RSIS) to provide real-time adjustments to operational intents based on changing airspace capacities, supporting effective demand-capacity balancing across the UTM network.
