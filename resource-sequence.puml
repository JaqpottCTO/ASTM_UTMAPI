==DCB subscribe to operations & resources==
DCB -> DSS: PUT /dss/v1/subscriptions/{subscriptionid}
note over DSS
    Subscription request includes
    indication of which data triggers
    notification when changed: 
    operations, constraints, and resources. 
end note
DCB <-- DSS: operational intent references & resource references

note over DCB
No resources or operational 
intents exist currently. 
Nothing to do yet. 
end note

==Make resources discoverable==
note over RO
Resource is originally
defined here.
end note 
RO -> RIS: Submit initial resource definition, capacity, and status
RIS -> DSS: PUT /dss/v1/resource_references/{entityid}
note over DSS
Resource reference creation
creates an implicit self-subscription
for any changes needed to the resource
due to OIM flight intents.
end note

loop For each resource subscriber
    DCB <-- RIS: POST /ris/v1/resource_details\n(includes resource reference, physical definition & default capacity, and current status)

note over DCB
Assumption: ResourceDetails contains definition,
status, and capacity. 
end note

== Resource capacity is updated ==
RO -> RIS: Update a future resource capacity
RIS -> DSS: PUT /dss/v1/resource_references/{entityid}/{ovn} (updateType=CAPACITY)
RIS <-- DSS: subscribers, resource-reference including updated ovn
loop For each resource subscriber

== Resource status is updated ==
RO -> RIS: Update resource status or current capacity
RIS -> DSS: PUT /dss/v1/resource_references/{entityid}/{ovn} (updateType=STATUS)
RIS <-- DSS: subscribers, resource-reference including updated ovn
loop For each resource subscriber

== Resource definition is updated ==

RIS <-- DSS: subscribers, resource-reference including updated ovn
loop For each resource subscriber
    RIS -> DCB: PUT /ris/v1/resource-details/{resource-id}/definition\n(includes reference-reference, physical definition & default capacity)
end

== A new subscriber joins == 
DCB2 -> DSS: PUT /dss/v1/subscriptions/{subscriptionid}
DCB2 <-- DSS: operational intent references & resource references

loop For each resource reference received
    note over DCB2
    Get all resource details.
    end note
    DCB2 -> RIS: GET /ris/v1/resource_details/{entityid}\n(includes resource reference, physical definition & default capacity, and current status)
    DCB2 <-- RIS: resource details (includes resource reference, physical definition & default capacity, and current status)
end


== OIM2 submits an operation to the DSS == 
OIM2 -> DSS: PUT /dss/v1/operational_intent_references/{entityId}  (Proposed state)
note over DSS
Does not check any OVNs here.
All operation intents accepted.
end note
OIM2 <-- DSS: subscribers to notify
loop For all subscribers
    ' OIM2 -> RIS: /psu/v1/operational_intents (includes OVN)

    DCB2 -> DCB2: Adjust demand/capacity values
end

== OIM wants to transition operation to Accepted state (OVNs required) ==
' OIM -> DCB: Get available resources
' OIM <-- DCB: Return all resources, OVNs, avaialble time ranges


OIM -> DCB: Submit proposed intent
OIM <-- DCB: Yes/no, OVNs for all resources, available time ranges

OIM -> DSS: PUT /dss/v1/operation_intent_references/{entityId}/{ovn}\n(state = Accepted)
DSS -> DSS: Confirms OVNs are correct
OIM <-- DSS: operation intent reference with subscribers
loop For all subscribers
    OIM -> DCB2: PUT /psu/v1/operational_intents
    OIM -> DCB: PUT /psu/v1/operational_intents
