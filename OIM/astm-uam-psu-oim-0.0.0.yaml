        The PSU hosting this endpoint returns the details (and reference) of an
        operational intent it manages.  While the PSU has a pending request to change the
        operational intent in the DSS, the PSU should report the most recent version the
        PSU knows was accepted by the DSS.  So, before a PSU receives a response
        to create an operational intent reference in the DSS, it should return 404 if
        queried for that operational intent at this endpoint.
